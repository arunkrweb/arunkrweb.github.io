Hi! Iâ€™m Arun, a Project Associate at the [Robert Bosch Center for Cyber Physical Systems](http://rbccps.org) at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. I am currently teaching robots how to perform various tasks using machine learning. More specifically, I'm applying machine learning techniques like meta-learning with imitation to make robots learn manipulation tasks. The project is being supervised by [Dr. Shishir N Y Kolathaya](https://shishirny.github.io/)(RBCCPS, IISc), [Prof. Shalabh Bhatnagar](https://drona.csa.iisc.ac.in/~shalabh/)(Dept. of Computer Science and Automation, IISc) and [Prof. Bharadwaj Amrutur](http://www.cense.iisc.ac.in/bharadwaj-amrutur)(Dept. of Electrical Communication Engineering & RBCCPS, IISc). Previous to this, I had worked on projects involving Reinforcement Learning, and Human motion analysis using Optical Motion Capture under the supervision of [Dr. S N Omkar](http://www.aero.iisc.ernet.in/people/s-n-omkar/)(Dept. of Aerospace Engineering, IISc). In my college days, I used to build internet of things (IoT) projects. Some of my works have won reputed competitions like [Intel Ultimate Coder Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKi9sdrSmiA)(special mention by Intel [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJBsjNRlVZI)), [Eclispe Open IoT Challenge](https://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/20160310_iotchallenge_winners2016.php) and [Intel IoT Roadshow](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByuvNaTkATl-MUlRWnh4Nl9uaVE/view?usp=sharing). 


I graduated First Class with Distinction in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering from the [University of Pune(SPPU)](http://www.unipune.ac.in/) in the year 2016. Over the span of last 5 years, I have acquired the skills to build projects revolving around machine learning, robotics simulation and IoT.
