Hi! Iâ€™m Arun, a Project Associate at the [Robert Bosch Center for Cyber Physical Systems](http://rbccps.org) at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. I am currently teaching robots how to perform various tasks using machine learning. More specifically, I'm applying machine learning techniques like meta-learning with imitation to make robots learn manipulation tasks. Previous to this, I had worked on projects involving Reinforcement Learning, Human motion analysis using Optical Motion Capture, and Internet of things (IOT). Some of my works have won reputed competetions like [Intel Ultimate Coder Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKi9sdrSmiA), [Eclispe Open IoT Challenge](https://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/20160310_iotchallenge_winners2016.php) and [Intel IoT Roadshow](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByuvNaTkATl-MUlRWnh4Nl9uaVE/view?usp=sharing). 


I received my BE in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from the [University of Pune](http://www.unipune.ac.in/). Over the span of last 5-6 years, I have gone through a technological roller-coaster ride covering diverse fields like electronics, embedded, IOT, Android, Robotics and Machine Learning.
