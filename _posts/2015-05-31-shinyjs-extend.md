About a month ago I made [an announcement](https://deanattali.com/2015/04/23/shinyjs-r-package) about the initial release of `shinyjs`. After some feedback, a few feature requests, and numerous hours of work, I'm excited to say that a new version of `shinyjs` v0.0.6.2 was made available on CRAN this week. The package's main objective is to make shiny app development better and easier by allowing you to perform many useful functions with simple R code that would normally require JavaScript coding. Some of the features include hiding/showing elements, enabling/disabling inputs, resetting an input to its original value, and many others. 

# Important note

**The package has improved a lot since writing this post. I highly recommend you stop reading this page and instead go the [shinyjs website](https://deanattali.com/shinyjs).**

## Availability {#availability}

`shinyjs` is available through both [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinyjs/)
(`install.packages("shinyjs")`) and [GitHub](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs)
(`devtools::install_github("daattali/shinyjs")`). Use the GitHub version to get the latest version with the newest features.

## Quick overview of new features {#overview}

This post will only discuss new features in `shinyjs`. You can find out more about the package [in the initial post](https://deanattali.com/2015/04/23/shinyjs-r-package) or [in the package README on GitHub](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs#readme). Remember that in order to use any function, you need to add a call to `useShinyjs()` in the shiny app's UI.

#### Two major new features:

- `reset` function allows inputs to be reset to their original value
- `extendShinyjs` allows you to add your own JavaScript functions and easily call them from R as regular R code

#### Two major improvements:

- Enabling and disabling of input widgets now works on **all** types of shiny inputs (many people asked how to disable a slider/select input/date range/etc, and `shinyjs` now handles all of them)
- The `toggle` functions gained an additional `condition` argument, which can be used to show/hide or enable/disable an element based on a condition. For example, instead of writing code such as `if (test) enable(id) else disable(id)`, you can simply write `toggleState(id, test)`

#### Three new features available on the GitHub version but not yet on CRAN:

- `hidden` (used to initialize a shiny tag as hidden) can now accept any number of tags or a tagList rather than just a single tag
- `hide`/`show`/`toggle` can be run on any JQuery selector, not only on a single ID, so that you can hide multiple elements simultaneously 
- `hide`/`show`/`toggle` have a new arugment `delay` which can be used to perform the action later rather than immediately. This can be useful if you want to show a message and have it disappear after a few seconds

## Two major new features {#new-features}

There were two major features that I wanted to include in the CRAN release.

### `reset` -  allows inputs to be reset to their original value {#reset}

Being able to reset the value of an input has been a frequently asked question on StackOverflow and the shiny Google Group, but a general solution was never available.  Now with `shinyjs` it's possible and very easy: if you have an input with id `name` and you want to reset it to its original value, simply call `reset("name")`. It doesn't matter what type of input it is - `reset` works with all shiny inputs.  

The `reset` function only takes one arugment, an HTML id, and resets all inputs inside of that element. This makes `reset` very flexible because you can either give it a single input widget to reset, or a form that contains many inputs and reset them all. Note that `reset` can only work on inputs that are generated from the app's ui and it will not work for inputs generated dynamically using `uiOutput`/`renderUI`.

Here is a simple demo of reset in action

[![Reset demo]({{ site.url }}/img/blog/shinyjs-improvements/reset-demo.gif)]({{ site.url }}/img/blog/shinyjs-improvements/reset-demo.gif)

### `extendShinyjs` - allows you to easily call your own JavaScript functions from R {#extendshinyjs}

The main idea behind `shinyjs` when I started working on it was to make it extremely easy to call JavaScript functions that I used commonly from R. Now whenever I want to add a new function to `shinyjs` (such as the `reset` function), all I have to do is write the JavaScript function, and the integration between shiny and JavaScript happens seamlessly thanks to `shinyjs`.  My main goal after the initial release was to also allow anyone else to use the same smooth R --> JS workflow, so that anyone can add a JavaScript function and call it from R easily. With the `extendShinyjs` function, that is now possible.

#### Very simple example

Using `extendShinyjs` is very simple and makes defining and calling JavaScript functions painless. Here is a very basic example of using `extendShinyjs` to define a (fairly useless) function that changes the colour of the page.

```r
library(shiny)
library(shinyjs)

jsCode <- "shinyjs.pageCol = function(params){$('body').css('background', params);}"

runApp(shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    useShinyjs(),
    extendShinyjs(text = jsCode),
    selectInput("col", "Colour:",
                c("white", "yellow", "red", "blue", "purple"))
  ),
  server = function(input,output,session) {
    observeEvent(input$col, {
      js$pageCol(input$col)
    })
  }
))
```

Running the code above produces this shiny app:

[![Extendshinyjs demo]({{ site.url }}/img/blog/shinyjs-improvements/extendshinyjs-demo.gif)]({{ site.url }}/img/blog/shinyjs-improvements/extendshinyjs-demo.gif)

See how easy that was? All I had to do was make the JavaScript function `shinyjs.pageCol`, pass the JavaScript code as an argument to `extendShinyjs`, and then I can call `js$pageCol()`.  That's the basic idea: any JavaScript function named `shinyjs.foo` will be available to call as `js$foo()`. You can either pass the JS code as a string to the `text` argument, or place the JS code in a separate JavaScript file and use the `script` argument to specify where the code can be found. Using a separate file is generally prefered over writing the code inline, but in these examples I will use the `text` argument to keep it simple.

Note: in order to use `extendShinyjs`, you must have the `V8` package installed. You can install it with `install.packages("V8")`.

#### Passing arguments from R to JavaScript

Any `shinyjs` function that is called will pass a single array-like parameter to its corresponding JavaScript function. If the function in R was called with unnamed arguments, then it will pass an Array of the arguments; if the R arguments are named then it will pass an Object with key-value pairs. For example, calling `js$foo("bar", 5)` in R will call `shinyjs.foo(["bar", 5])` in JS, while calling `js$foo(num = 5, id = "bar")` in R will call `shinyjs.foo({num : 5, id : "bar"})` in JS. This means the `shinyjs.foo` function needs to be able to deal with both types of parameters.

To assist in normalizing the parameters, `shinyjs` provides a `shinyjs.getParams()` function which serves two purposes. First of all, it ensures that all arguments are named (even if the R function was called without names). Secondly, it allows you to define default values for arguments. Here is an example of a JS function that changes the background colour of an element and uses `shinyjs.getParams()`.

```javascript
shinyjs.backgroundCol = function(params) {
  var defaultParams = {
    id : null,
    col : "red"
  };
  params = shinyjs.getParams(params, defaultParams);

  var el = $("#" + params.id);
  el.css("background-color", params.col);
}
```

Note the `defaultParams` that we defined and the call to `shinyjs.getParams`. It ensures that calling `js$backgroundCol("test", "blue")` and `js$backgroundCol(id = "test", col = "blue")` and `js$backgroundCol(col = "blue", id = "test")` are all equivalent, and that if the colour parameter is not provided then "red" will be the default.  All the functions provided in `shinyjs` make use of `shinyjs.getParams`, and it is highly recommended to always use it in your functions as well. Notice that the order of the arguments in `defaultParams` in the JavaScript function matches the order of the arguments when calling the function in R with unnamed arguments. This means that `js$backgroundCol("blue", "test")` will not work because the arguments are unnamed and the JS function expects the id to come before the colour.

For completeness, here is the code for a shiny app that uses the above function (it's not a very practical example, but it's great for showing how to use `extendShinyjs` with parameters):

```r
library(shiny)
library(shinyjs)

jsCode <- '
shinyjs.backgroundCol = function(params) {
  var defaultParams = {
    id : null,
    col : "red"
  };
  params = shinyjs.getParams(params, defaultParams);

  var el = $("#" + params.id);
  el.css("background-color", params.col);
}'

runApp(shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    useShinyjs(),
    extendShinyjs(text = jsCode),
    p(id = "name", "My name is Dean"),
    p(id = "sport", "I like soccer"),
    selectInput("col", "Colour:",
                c("white", "yellow", "red", "blue", "purple")),    
    textInput("selector", "Element", ""),
    actionButton("btn", "Go")
  ),
  server = function(input,output,session) {
    observeEvent(input$btn, {
      js$backgroundCol(input$selector, input$col)
    })
  }
))
```

And the resulting app:

[![Extendshinyjs params demo]({{ site.url }}/img/blog/shinyjs-improvements/extendshinyjs-params.gif)]({{ site.url }}/img/blog/shinyjs-improvements/extendshinyjs-params.gif)

Note that I chose to define the JS code as a string for illustration purposes, but in reality I would prefer to place the code in a separate file and use the `script` argument instead of `text`.

## Two major improvements {#improvements-features}

Among the many small improvements made, there are two that will be the most useful.

### Enabling/disabling works on all inputs {#disable-all}

The initial release of `shinyjs` had a `disable`/`enable` function which worked on the major input types that I was commonly using, but not all. Several people noticed that various inputs could not be disabled, so I made sure to fix all of them in the next version.  The reasons behind why not all inputs were easy to disable are very technical so I won't go into them.  Now calling `disable(id)` or `enable(id)` will work on any type of shiny input. 

### Use a `condition` in `toggle` functions {#toggle-condition}

I've noticed that some users of `shinyjs` had to often write code such as `if (test) enable(id) else disable(id)`. This seemed inefficient and verbose, especially since there was already a `toggleState` function that enables disabled elements and vice versa. The `toggleState` function now has a new `condition` parameter to address exactly this problem. The code above can now be rewritten as `toggleState(id, test)`.

Similarly, code that previously used `if (test) show(id) else hide(id)` can now use `toggle(id = id, condition = test)`, and code that was doing a similar thing with `addClass`/`removeClass` can use the `toggleClass(id, class, condition)` function.

## Three new features available on the GitHub version but not yet on CRAN {#extra-features}

Since submitting `shinyjs` to CRAN, there were a few more features added. They will go into the next CRAN submission in about a month, but for now they can be used if you download the GitHub version.

### `hidden` now accepts multiple tags {#hidden}

The `hidden` function is the only `shinyjs` function that's used in the UI rather than in the server. It's used to initialize a tag as hidden, and you can later reveal it using `show(tag)`.  The initial release only allows single tags to be given to `hidden`, but now it can accept any number of tags or a tagList. For example, you can now add a button and some text to the UI and have them both hidden with this code: `hidden(actionButton("btn", "Button"), p(id = "text", "text"))`. You can then call `show("btn")` or `show("text")` to unhide them.

### Visibility functions can be run on any selector {#visibility-selector}

Previously, the only way to tell the `hide`, `show`, and `toggle` functions what element to act on was to give them an ID. That becomes very limiting when you want to hide or show elements in batch, or even if you just want to show/hide an element without an ID. The visibility functions now have a new optional parameter `selector` that accepts any CSS-style selector. For example, to hide all hyperlinks on a page that have the class "hide-me-later" you can now call `hide(selector = "a.hide-me-later")`. This makes the visibility functions much more powerful.

### Visibility functions can be delayed {#visibility-delay}

In a shiny app that I'm currently developing for my graduate work there are many different "Update" buttons that the user can click on. After an update is successful, I wanted to show a "Done!" message that would disappear after a few seconds.  Using `shinyjs` I was already able to show the message when I wanted to, but I needed an easy way to make it disappear later. So I added the `delay` parameter to `show`/`hide`/`toggle`, that tells the function to only act in x seconds instead of immediately. Now if I want to show a message and hide it after 5 seconds, I can call `show("doneMsg"); hide(id = "doneMsg", delay = 5)`.  It's not a big deal, but it can be handy.

## Feedback + suggestions {#feedback}

If you have any feedback on `shinyjs`, I'd love to [hear about it]({{ site.url }}/aboutme#contact)!  I really do hope that it's as easy to use as possible and that many of you will find it useful. If you have any suggestions, please do [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs/issues) or let me know in any other way.
