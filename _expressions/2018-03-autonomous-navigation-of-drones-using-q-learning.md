author_profile: false
excerpt: "This project implements autonomous navigation of an ARDrone in Gazebo simulator. Q-Learning algorithm was used in a simple gridworld setting. The state space included the current coordinates of the drone. A reward of -1 was given upon not ending up in the goal state and a reward of +100 was awarded for reaching to the goal."
