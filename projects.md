This is a collection of some personal projects I've worked on that are easily viewable online. Anything that is not browser-friendly will not make the cut :(

I'm also [**available for consulting**](/shiny), so feel free to [contact me](/contact) if you'd like to work together.

## Courses

I have an interactive, online video course ["Case Studies in Shiny"](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/building-web-applications-in-r-with-shiny-case-studies) hosted on DataCamp. It's designed to give you practice building Shiny apps for real-life scenarios, while also helping your learn some advanced Shiny concepts.

## Website templates

-  **[Beautiful Jekyll](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/)** - a popular Jekyll theme I created when making this website.  You can [view a demo](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) or use it yourself to make a pretty website similar to this one by visiting the [project page](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#readme). The theme is extremely easy to install - you can have a site up and running in 2 minutes, and it is designed to look great on both mobile devices and laptops.

## Web services

- **[CRANalerts](https://cranalerts.com/)** - Get email alerts when a CRAN package gets updated.

## R Shiny apps

If you got here after reading some of my blog posts, you'll know that I'm a big fan and advocate of Shiny. I also run a company providing Shiny consultancy. Unfortunately all my coolest big Shiny apps that were made for clients are private, but you can see a sample of the Shiny apps I've built for myself [on my Shiny server](/shiny).

*Many of my R packages/tutorials/thoughts are graciously shared on [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/), which is a great resource for any useR.*

## Chrome extensions

- **[GitHub Diff Navigator](https://github.com/daattali/github-diff-navigator-extension)** - allows you to easily navigate through the changes in a file that has been edited on GitHub.  Especially useful when editing a markdown file within the browser, as GitHub will only show you the full changed file but not show you *where* the edits were made. I find this very helpful every time I make small edits to someone else's large markdown document.  [Get the extension at the Google Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-diff-navigator/aoojogkiedabnddmokieplfnmjehlneo)

- **[Google Slides Auto Resize Speaker Notes](https://github.com/daattali/gslides-betternotes-extension)** - the slide previews in the Speaker Notes window of Google Slides are tiny and unreadable. This extension dynamically resizes the slides based on the window size to make them useful. [Get the extension at the Google Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-slides-auto-resize/piciggpbidhfbpefjjbomcgomanjfbeb)

- **[Project Free TV Ad Bypass](https://github.com/daattali/pftv-ad-bypass-extension)** - Project Free TV serves a 10-second ad page before allowing users to continue to the video - this extension bypasses the ad page. [Get the extension at the Google Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/project-free-tv-ad-bypass/modfjcgeknfglkdgckkomdcgokkjaadd)

- **[Smileyfy My Facebook](https://github.com/daattali/smileyfy-my-facebook-extension)** -  Chrome extension that adds infinite happiness to your Facebook browsing, plus a little bonus rickrolling :)  This is not the most useful (if at all..), but it was a way for me to learn about some more advanced features of Chrome extension development. [Get the extension at the Google Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/smileyfy-my-facebook/ideagdnlnmgjdhhbelgadnakbhphljol)

## Websites

- **[Wish.com](https://wish.com)** - a very popular shopping platform. I was one of the few original developers of the site (before it was even called Wish!) and contributed mostly to the frontend. I was part of Wish's inception and initial growth, but since then it has grown to be a #1 Android Shopping app, and I can't claim any credit to that. :)

- **[MakeupBee.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20121223025414/https://www.makeupbee.com/looks.php)** - website for women to discover and talk about interesting makeup applications. Clearly my area of expertise! The site was mostly developed by Brent Francia (CEO) and I, and I was responsible for all aspects of the development, seeing as we were usually a 2-3 person team.

- **[Glittr.com](https://www.glittr.com)** - spin-off of MakeupBee that was designed to be more focused on mainstream looks and have a cleaner feel. I've written most of the code for this site.

- **[Jauntr.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20120309093005/https://www.jauntr.com/)** - travel site with a social component, that is meant to help users discover and share places to go. It never really took off, but it was my first introduction to web development.

- **[daattali.com](https://daattali.com)** - small personal website that I run on a virtual server just because I wanted a place to host my own [R Shiny server](https://daattali.com/shiny) and [RStudio server](https://daattali.com/rstudio).

- **[deanattali.com](https://deanattali.com)** - the site you're currently on.  Just a simple site to have some virtual presence.

## Misc

- **[Impact Replays](https://daattali.com/shiny/cfl/)** - I participated in a national hackathon ([SportsHack15](http://sportshackweekend.org/ca/2015/)) and won 3rd place with this app. We had to build something that would increase engagement of CFL (Canadian Football League) fans. This app uses play-by-play data from games to let you focus on just the action moments of games.

- **[Minesweeper](/files/Minesweeper)** - tiny Minesweeper game I built as part of the interview process with Airbnb.  It's not fancy at all, but it's the best I could do in the two hours they allotted me back in the day.

- **[Building your own portable oldies gaming console](https://github.com/daattali/rasperry-pi-gaming-console-setup)** - I bought a raspberry pi and turned it into an awesome portable gaming console that supports SNES/PS1/GameGear/GameBoy.  Super cool.

## Java games

I have several cool Java games I wrote, but I currently don't have a way to host the applet online without paying way too much money to buy a certificate.  I might find a way around that in the future.
