<h2>Target pose estimation and reaching using supervised learning</h2>

<p>
This is an ongoing project whose main goal is to teach manipulation tasks to the robot by observing humans perform the tasks. This observation is fed to the robot in the form of image sequences or a video. In this post I will try to explain some of the preliminary implementation of one part of the project that is estimating the target position.
