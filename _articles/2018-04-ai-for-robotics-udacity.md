<p style="text-align:justify">
This project develops on the assignment given in the Udacity's course on Artificial Intelligence for Robotics by Sebastian Thrun. I wanted to build a GUI that could better illustrate the concepts in the course. I used pygame to build an application that demonstrates planning, navigation and control using concepts like A-star, particle filter, PID control, etc.
