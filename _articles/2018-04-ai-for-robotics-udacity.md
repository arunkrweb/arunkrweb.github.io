<p>
This project develops on the assignment given in the Udacity's course on Artificial Intelligence for Robotics by Sebastian Thrun. I tried to use the example of the robotic car in the course and develop a pygame application to illustrate how concepts of the course look visually. I have demonstrated stuffs like A-star, particle filter, PID control, bicycle model, etc.
